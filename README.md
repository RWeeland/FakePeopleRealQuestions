#Fake People Real Questions

##history
This project was originally made by The Rubin. It was a project made to help people learn how to read the tarot. This was done by generating random questions together with an AI generated face, giving a spontaneous twist to the practice sessions.

#How to use this
If you want to learn how to read the tarot just:
1. shuffle the deck
2. place down a three-card spread
3. generate a question
4. open your spread and answer the question
